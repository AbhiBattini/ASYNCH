# ASYNCH
The code for the separate pieces of the ASYNCH Lead Synthesis AI Model Architecture, which synthesizes the 12 leads of an ECG from Leads I, II, and V1. There are Examples such as the LinearRNN network and Squeeze-Excitation Networks.

Highlights of the model:
* Linear Recurrent Neural Networks were designed
* ASYNCH Model is a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture; and uses alternating encoder-decoder networks in the Transformer portion
* Output layer is a Feed-Forward Neural Network instead of a Convolutional Layer for finer detail
